Projects Related to Python Web Development

Project 1,Wiki:

Wikipedia is a free, open content online encyclopedia created through the collaborative effort of a community of users known as Wikipedians. 
Anyone registered on the site can create an article for publication; registration is not required to edit articles. 
One of my intial projects in Django is a protype of Wikipedia using Django,HTML,CSS.
Currently the project is not hosted on server but has been uploaded on my github, kindly have a look and do comment on it.
I have recently started a youtube channel to support my python coding journey.
I have shown the entire project on the youtube channel below.

Main functionalities provided by this:- 

Entry Page: Visiting /wiki/TITLE, where TITLE is the title of an encyclopedia entry, should render a page that displays the contents of that encyclopedia entry.
Index Page: Which shows a list of all the pages created on the Wiki.
Search: Allow the user to type a query into the search box in the sidebar to search for an encyclopedia entry.
New Page: Clicking “Create New Page” in the sidebar should take the user to a page where they can create a new encyclopedia entry.
Edit Page: On each entry page, the user can click a link to be taken to a page where the user can edit that entry’s Markdown content in a textarea.
The textarea should be pre-populated with the existing Markdown content of the page. (i.e., the existing content should be the initial value of the textarea).
Random Page: Clicking “Random Page” in the sidebar should take user to a random encyclopedia entry.
