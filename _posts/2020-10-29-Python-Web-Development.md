This blog gives a brief description on all my web development projects.I have chosen python and Django for web development due to the following reasons:-
Easy to learn and use,Versatile and runs on all the platform,Django framework is powerful and finally i have intersts in the fields of Machine Learning , Big Data and AI, python is one of the core languages and hence compatible too.

## Project 1,Wiki:

Wikipedia is a free, open content online encyclopedia created through the collaborative effort of a community of users known as Wikipedians. 
Anyone registered on the site can create an article for publication; registration is not required to edit articles. 
One of my intial projects in Django is a protype of Wikipedia using Django,HTML,CSS.
Currently the project is not hosted on server but has been uploaded on my github, kindly have a look and do comment on it.
I have recently started a youtube channel to support my python coding journey.
I have shown the entire project on the youtube channel below.

## Project 2,Learning Log:

Learning log is a step ahead of the previous project. 
In this project a user can log all his/her learnings. Edit the learnings , and view all the learnings in your profile.
In this project, other than handing views, forms, and Html ,CSS,it involved Models.
Model is defining the database in pyhton or high level language which in turn gets created in the SQl format once we make migrations and migrate the databse.
Hence this project i had a learning of implementation of Databses, foreign Keys, and dependencies betwen the tables and to design the tables and make it as conssitent 
and reduce the redundancy to make a good website.
This can be reused as a blogging app too.
