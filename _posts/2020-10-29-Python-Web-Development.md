This blog gives a brief description on all my web development projects.I have chosen python and Django for web development due to the following reasons:-
Easy to learn and use,Versatile and runs on all the platform,Django framework is powerful and finally i have intersts in the fields of Machine Learning , Big Data and AI, python is one of the core languages and hence compatible too.

## Project 1,Wiki:

Wikipedia is a free, open content online encyclopedia created through the collaborative effort of a community of users known as Wikipedians. 
Anyone registered on the site can create an article for publication; registration is not required to edit articles. 
One of my intial projects in Django is a protype of Wikipedia using Django,HTML,CSS.
Currently the project is not hosted on server but has been uploaded on my github, kindly have a look and do comment on it.
